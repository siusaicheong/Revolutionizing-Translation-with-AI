# Revolutionizing Translation with AI: Unravelling Neural Machine Translation and Generative Pre-trained Large Language Models

Author: SIU Sai Cheong (July 2023)

## Abstract
This work explores the technical advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) for translation, focusing on neural machine translation (NMT) and large language models (LLMs) as primary drivers of progress. We analyze foundational deep learning techniques, the influential Transformer model, and the strengths and weaknesses of NMT and LLMs for translation. Moreover, we offer practical recommendations for translation educators and developers on how to effectively harness AIâ€™s power while addressing potential challenges. Our goal is to enhance understanding of AI-driven translation technologies and equip language professionals with the knowledge needed to make informed decisions when using these cutting-edge tools.
